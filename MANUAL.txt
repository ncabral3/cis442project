READ ME - CIS 442 PROJECT - NICK CABRAL

This project aims to detect when a file extension has been changed. To do this the program will compare the file signature of a given file to a list of different file signatures. If the signature is different from what the file is masquerading as it will be detected in the terminal. 


Step 1: Open "CIS442Project.py" in an IDE of your choosing. 

Step 2: Once opened change the path at the top to whatever path your file with your test cases is stored 

Step 3: Run the program in the IDE and the console will state what files were detected as not a match with their respective file signature
